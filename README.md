## Overview

This project uses D3.js to create an interactive force-directed graph visualization. The graph represents a hierarchical structure with main nodes and their respective child nodes.

## Features

- **Force-Directed Layout:** Utilizes the force-directed layout algorithm for an aesthetically pleasing and dynamic graph representation.
- **Interactive Nodes:** Nodes can be clicked to reveal or hide their child nodes, providing a collapsible functionality.
- **Zoom In/Out:** Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the graph for a closer or broader view.
- **Drag Functionality:** Click and drag on the graph to reposition and explore different parts of the visualization.
- **Tooltips:** Hover over nodes to display tooltips with additional information.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/): A JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations in the browser.
